# BasicArnoldCatMap
A small C++ program that computes the first iteration of an Arnold Cat Map algorithm. It uses the EasyBMP library.

This was made for a university project.

## Usage
Enter in the terminal:
```
g++ -o CatMap main.cpp
./CatMap example.bmp
```
With `example.bmp` being the file you want to transform.
The result will be inside `output/`.
